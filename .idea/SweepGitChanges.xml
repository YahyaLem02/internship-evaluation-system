        <option value="Set up the foundational front-end architecture by creating the base layout, templates, and core UI components. Added `DashboardLayout.jsx` to structure the main app layout with a sidebar and header. Created key pages: `Dashboard.jsx`, `Profile.jsx`, and `Login.jsx`, each styled with Tailwind CSS and animated using Framer Motion. Built reusable components like `Sidebar.jsx`, `Header.jsx`, `Modal.jsx`, and `AnimatedButton.jsx` to support navigation, modals, and interactive UI elements. Updated `App.jsx` to configure routing with React Router, integrating the new layout and pages. Modified `package.json` and `package-lock.json` to install necessary dependencies (`framer-motion`, `@headlessui/react`, `react-icons`, etc.). Cleaned up old files (`Home.jsx`, `About.jsx`, `Footer.jsx`) that were no longer needed. Enhanced `index.css` with a background gradient for a polished visual base. Overall, this commit establishes a scalable and animated UI framework for the application." />
        <option value="Set up Tailwind CSS configuration for the front-end project. Added `postcss.config.cjs` to configure PostCSS with Tailwind CSS and Autoprefixer plugins, enabling Tailwind's utility-first styling and automatic vendor prefixing. Created `SweepGitChanges.xml` to store recent commit summaries for project tracking within the IDE, supporting better development workflow documentation." />
        <option value="Set up initial front-end project structure with React, React Router, and Tailwind CSS. Added `package-lock.json` to lock dependencies and updated `package.json` to include `react-router-dom`, `tailwindcss`, `postcss`, and `autoprefixer`. Replaced default Vite `App.jsx` content with a router-based layout including `Header`, `Footer`, `Home`, and `About` components. Created new files `Header.jsx`, `Footer.jsx`, `Home.jsx`, and `About.jsx` to structure the app. Replaced default styles in `index.css` with Tailwind CSS directives. Added `tailwind.config.js` for Tailwind configuration. Updated `eslint.config.js` to include Node.js globals. Added `jsLibraryMappings.xml` for IDE JavaScript library configuration." />
