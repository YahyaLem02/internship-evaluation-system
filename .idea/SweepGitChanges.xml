Modified `compiler.xml` to update the Lombok annotation processor path, although the version reference was changed to &quot;unknown,&quot; which may require correction. These changes are part of the initial backend setup process." />
        <option value="Updated Lombok dependency version in `compiler.xml` to 1.18.36 to ensure compatibility and proper annotation processing during compilation. Added a new `.name` file with the content &quot;Periode.java&quot;, likely to define the project or module name, aiding in project organization. These changes support the ongoing task of finalizing the backend development." />
