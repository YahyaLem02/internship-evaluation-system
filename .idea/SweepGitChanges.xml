        <option value="Updated `SweepGitChanges.xml` to add a new recent commit summary entry. This change documents the setup of the backend project configuration, including the addition of the `SweepGitChanges.xml` file itself and modifications to `compiler.xml` for updating the Lombok annotation processor path. The update helps maintain a clear history of project changes and supports better project organization and version control." />
        <option value="Set up Tailwind CSS configuration for the front-end project. Added `postcss.config.cjs` to configure PostCSS with Tailwind CSS and Autoprefixer plugins, enabling Tailwind's utility-first styling and automatic vendor prefixing. Created `SweepGitChanges.xml` to store recent commit summaries for project tracking within the IDE, supporting better development workflow documentation." />
        <option value="Set up initial front-end project structure with React, React Router, and Tailwind CSS. Added `package-lock.json` to lock dependencies and updated `package.json` to include `react-router-dom`, `tailwindcss`, `postcss`, and `autoprefixer`. Replaced default Vite `App.jsx` content with a router-based layout including `Header`, `Footer`, `Home`, and `About` components. Created new files `Header.jsx`, `Footer.jsx`, `Home.jsx`, and `About.jsx` to structure the app. Replaced default styles in `index.css` with Tailwind CSS directives. Added `tailwind.config.js` for Tailwind configuration. Updated `eslint.config.js` to include Node.js globals. Added `jsLibraryMappings.xml` for IDE JavaScript library configuration." />
        <option value="Updated Lombok dependency version in `compiler.xml` to 1.18.36 to ensure compatibility and proper annotation processing during compilation. Added a new `.name` file with the content &quot;Periode.java&quot;, likely to define the project or module name, aiding in project organization. These changes support the ongoing task of finalizing the backend development." />
